Bonus) Expand your implementation in Problem 6 to order a sequence of points in the plane. More
speciﬁcally, given a list of tuples A = [(x1, y1), . . . , (xn, yn)] with the order (xi, yi)  (xj , yj ) if and only if
xi ≤ xj and yi ≤ yj . So, your program should return the ordered sequence. Note that not every sequence
in the plane can be ordered, check your code with the sequence [(9, 9), (8, 8), (7, 7), . . . , (1, 1)]. Hint. Do not
overthink this problem, you just need to expand the tuple comparison and your swap function, the rest of
the algorithm runs the same way
