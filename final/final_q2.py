'''
A survey was conducted about the reliability of a new test for COVID-19. A precise medical testing classified
the patients as healthy or sick and is encoded in the random variable Status. The area where the survey was
conducted has 10% COVID positive prevalence during the survey time. The output of the test is encoded
with the random variable X can have three outcomes: positive, negative, and inconclusive.
Status                     X
          Positive    Negative   Inconclusive
Healthy     0.08        0.80        0.12
Sick        0.82        0.09        0.09
Table 1: Distribution of the prediction of new test
(a) Using Bayesâ€™ theorem. Calculate P (Status = Healthy|X = Positive).
(b) Implement a Python program in which the user provides the prior prevalence distribution, and returns
the posterior probability P (Status = Healthy|X = x) for each value of x.

'''
To calculate (a), use the P(healthy) = 0.9 and P(sick) = 0.1 for the prior distributions. The result == 0.4675324675324675
For (b), the functions allow us to select x for healthy or sick to calculate the posterior probability
