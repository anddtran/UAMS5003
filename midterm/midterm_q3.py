'''
Compose a Python program that asks the user for two non-negative integers (m, n), and a number p ∈ (0, 1). The
program will build a Boolean matrix A = (ars) of type m × n in which the ars is T with probability p and F with
probability 1 − p. For reproducibility, set the seed of your random number generator to 500323.
